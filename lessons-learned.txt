I have used github in the past, but a refresher is always nice

Firstly, we needed an update on the master-main situation. Git does not permit new repos pushed as masters anymore, due to the politics du jour.
Please update the text to say "main" instead of master, as the commands don't work.

Also, when adding a remote bookmark to the repo, the "origin" tag needs to be added, i.e. git remote add origin URL-for-the-project.

Otherwise, it was a good intro to git; students will likely learn how to merge branches at another date.

Thank you!
